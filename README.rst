JPype
=====

JPype is an effort to allow python programs full access to java class libraries.

Find the `documentation at Read the Docs <http://jpype.readthedocs.org>`__.

Current development is done in `the github project <https://github.com/originell/jpype>`__.
The work on this project began on `Sourceforge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpype/>`__.

This fork is focused on increasing stability of the v0.5 series for Python 2.7 so JPype
can be used successfully in production environments. Bug fixes will be backported from
current development as needed, but new experimental features will not be merged to avoid
introducing regressions.

Compatibilty with Python 3 is not a goal for this fork.

Publishing precompiled binaries (pip wheels) for Linux, Mac, and Windows on PyPI is a
wishlisted goal at the moment.
